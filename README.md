# hello-world
Created for the purposes of learning GitHub
I am a fisheries researcher learning GitHub so I can create a software package in R Studio
This package will hopefully provide an R version of a commonly used program (FAMS) for simulating the effects of regulations on fish populations
This is my first experience learning to create a statistical package, and I am excited to learn a lot and be challenged.
